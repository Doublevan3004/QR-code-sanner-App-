Project in Maintenance Mode Only
The project is in maintenance mode, meaning, changes are driven by contributed patches. Only bug fixes and minor enhancements will be considered. The Barcode Scanner app can no longer be published, so it's unlikely any changes will be accepted for it. There is otherwise no active development or roadmap for this project. It is "DIY".
